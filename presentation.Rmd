## What's Ahead?

- Reproducible Research and Reporting - R Style
- Developments in cloud QA
- Animation


# Reproducible Research
## What is it?
*The goal of reproducible research is to tie specific instructions to data analysis and experimental data so that scholarship can be recreated - [Max Kuhn](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ReproducibleResearch.html)* 

By using R Studio and R Markdown this becomes a much easier task.

## The concept

- Write your analysis code (from inputs to visualisations)
- Write explanatory text
- Weave the two into one standalone report 

## The benefits

- The analysis code is run to generate the report (it has to work!)
- The analysis can be re-run and the same results obtained
- An update of the raw data produces the "next" report (annual reports?)
- The report is rendered in HTML (easy to email, displays in a browser, looks professional)

## Examples

1. Statistical Report GAMMs
2. Modelling Wetlands

# Developments in cloud QA
##
![<small>https:\\xkcd.com</small>](cloud.png)

Cloud QA has become an increasingly important (and onerous) task in the 
processing stream for analysing dense time series


## The old method

1. Extract index values for each site for all scenes and store in a spreadsheet
2. Create ecw enhancements of each Landsat scene
3. Load into an ArcGIS mxd and check each scene for each site (532 images x *n* sites)
4. Delete index value from spreadsheet if cloud affected (up to 30 mins per site)
3. Time consuming, error prone and "laggy" due to rendering rates in ArcGIS

## The new method

1. Run R code which zooms to a site, stretches the Landsat scene, creates a jpeg and saves it to a
site specific QA folder (~ 7mins per site on 532 scenes)
2. Use Windows Explorer to view each scene and delete if cloud affected (~ 5mins per site for 532 scenes)
3. Run a second R code to obtain dates of good images from the QA folder, extract 
user supplied index and compile into a csv for further analysis
4. Plot the site values (use Plotly) and query remaining outliers in ArcGIS based on date

## Spinoffs!
- The jpeg creation code is good for other things too (fire scars)
- Writing the code has led to some other functions:
    + Code to split one shapefile into many based on an attribute
    + Code to rename ecw with reverse date (ordering in ArcGIS)
